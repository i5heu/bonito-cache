# bonito-cache
Just hook it in front of your public S3 bucket and enjoy reduction in bandwidth costs to your bucket

## Status
The project is working in its current state. It is not feature complete, but it is usable.
The code needs some cleanup, refactoring and most importantly tests.

## !WARNING!
This cache is still in development and is not ready for production use. It is not yet tested for security vulnerabilities.

## Available Environment Variables
* `BONITO_S3_ENDPOINT` - The endpoint of your S3 bucket. Defaults to `https://localhost`
* `BONITO_CORS_DOMAIN` - The domain to allow CORS requests from. Defaults to `https://example.com`
* `BONITO_USE_MAX_RAM_GB` - The maximum amount of RAM to use for caching. Defaults to `2` GB
* `BONITO_USE_MAX_DISK_GB` - The maximum amount of disk space to use for caching. Defaults to `25` GB
* `BONITO_STORAGE_PATH` - The path to store cached files. Defaults to `/cache`
* `BONITO_INFLUXDB_URL` - The URL of your InfluxDB instance. Defaults to `""`
* `BONITO_INFLUXDB_TOKEN` - The token to use for authentication with InfluxDB. Defaults to `""`
* `BONITO_INFLUXDB_ORG` - The organization to use for authentication with InfluxDB. Defaults to `""`
* `BONITO_INFLUXDB_BUCKET` - The bucket to use for authentication with InfluxDB. Defaults to `""`

## Docker Hub
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/i5heu/bonito-cache

## TODO for 1.0.0
- Add a CLI and API to delete a cached file
- refactor code
- build better docs
- rename project

## Future features 

Caching in cluster mode.  
If you build a cluster of bonito-cache instances, they will try to request a file from each other first before requesting it from the S3 bucket.
